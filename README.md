### Hiya, I'm Tan! :sunglasses: :football: :rowboat: 

I'm a data enthusiast who loves R, Shiny :star_struck:, NFL football, dynasty fantasy football and rowing. By day, I'm a data analyst and developer for [Caivan Communities](https://caivan.com) in Ottawa, Canada.

I'm most known for my [DynastyProcess project](https://github.com/DynastyProcess), which tries to deliver high quality resources in the form of Shiny apps and open data. I also build data tools and contribute at [DynastyLeagueFootball.com](https://dynastyleaguefootball.com).

I'm an avid member of the [R4DS Slack](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) where I enjoy answering Tidyverse and Shiny questions, as well as follow along with the [Advanced R Book Club](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-advanced_r) - I've even presented a few chapters!

Away from my keyboard, I'm a rower and coach for the [Ottawa Rowing Club](https://ottawarowingclub.com) - I'm a lead coach for the recreational/adult rowing programs. 

### Now
I'm currently absorbed in developing a brand new R package called [ffscrapR](https://github.com/DynastyProcess/ffscrapr) - which aims to consolidate access to fantasy football platform APIs into one definitive R package. I'm hoping get it submitted to CRAN one day soon!

I was inspired to have a [now page](https://tanho.ca/now) by Derek Sivers - the [big idea](https://nownownow.com/about) is that it's a page where you can learn what that person is focusing on at this point in their life. My entries are introspective and infrequent.

### Highlights
- DynastyProcess Trade Calculator - a Shiny app developed with shinyMobile that serves over 20,000 unique users per month. 
- AdvR presentation recordings

### Find me
I primarily use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@_TanHo) to keep up with R, data science, and dynastyFF - my DMs are open there!
