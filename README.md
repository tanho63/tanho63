## Hiya, I'm Tan!

I'm a data enthusiast who loves R/Shiny ü§©, DynastyFF üèà and rowing üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

By day, I'm a data developer and analyst for ABIC Builds in Ottawa, Canada. I started [DynastyProcess.com](https://dynastyprocess.com) and [ffverse](https://ffverse.com), stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tanho_), and contribute at [R4DS Slack Community](https://r4ds.io).

Away from my keyboard, I'm a rower and was previously a lead coach for the Ottawa Rowing Club.

#### Now
I have a [now page](https://tanho.ca/now)! It's a page where you can [learn about what someone is focusing on](https://nownownow.com/about) at this point in their lives. My entries are introspective and infrequent.
