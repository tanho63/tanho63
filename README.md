## Hiya, I'm Tan!

I'm a self-taught programmer who loves R, Shiny, fantasy football, and carving pumpkins.

By day, I'm an engineering lead for Teamworks Intelligence Soccer. I started [DynastyProcess.com](https://dynastyprocess.com) 
and [ffverse](https://ffverse.com), maintain [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse), and mentor at 
[Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io). 

In past lives, I have been a: residential property manager, construction data analyst, fantasy football 
writer, live-coding streamer, marathon rower, adult rowing coach, and more.

Away from my keyboard, I enjoy volleyball, powerlifting, rowing, skiing, cooking, and hanging out with my dog Jasper.
