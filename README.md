### Hiya, I'm Tan! :sunglasses: :football: :rowboat: 

I'm a data enthusiast who loves R/Shiny :star_struck:, NFL, DynastyFF and rowing. By day, I'm a data analyst and developer for [Caivan](https://caivan.com) in Ottawa, Canada. 

I started [DynastyProcess.com](https://dynastyprocess.com), and contribute at [DLF](https://dynastyleaguefootball.com/tools) and [R4DS Slack Community](https://rfordatasci.com/join). Away from my keyboard, I'm a rower and coach for the [Ottawa Rowing Club](https://ottawarowingclub.com) - I'm a lead coach for the recreational/adult rowing programs.

### Now
I was inspired to have a [now page](https://tanho.ca/now) by Derek Sivers - the [big idea](https://nownownow.com/about) is that it's a page where you can learn what that person is focusing on at this point in their life. My entries are introspective and infrequent.

### Highlights
- [DynastyProcess Trade Calculator](https://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calc) - a shinyMobile app fed by a weekly update pipeline, used by over 20,000 users each month to analyze dynasty trades and improve decision-making
- [ffscrapr R package](https://github.com/DynastyProcess/ffscrapr)
- [DynastyProcess on GitHub](https://github.com/DynastyProcess) - includes [open fantasy football data](https://github.com/DynastyProcess/data) and some [research](https://github.com/DynastyProcess/research)
- [AdvR Book Club](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-advanced_r) presentations : [Ch9 Functionals - Practical/Live-Code](https://youtu.be/o0a6aJ4kCkU), [Ch16 OOP Wrapup - Practical/Live-Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1uc8HbyZvI)

### Find me
I primarily use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@_TanHo) to keep up with R, data science, and dynastyFF - my DMs are open there!
