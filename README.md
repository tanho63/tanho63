## Hiya, I'm Tan!

I'm a data enthusiast who loves Rüí´, Shiny‚ú®, dynasty fantasy football üèà and carving pumpkins üéÉ

By day, I'm a data developer for ABIC Builds in Ottawa, Canada. 

I started [DynastyProcess.com](https://dynastyprocess.com) and [ffverse](https://ffverse.com), maintain [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse], stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tanho_), and contribute at [R4DS Slack Community](https://r4ds.io).

Away from my keyboard, I enjoy rowing and was previously a lead program coach for the Ottawa Rowing Club.
