## Hiya, I'm Tan! :sunglasses: :football: :rowboat: 

I'm a data enthusiast who loves R, Shiny :star_struck:, NFL football, dynasty fantasy football and rowing. By day, I'm a data analyst and developer for [Caivan Communities](https://caivan.com) in Ottawa, Canada.

I'd say that I'm most known for my [DynastyProcess project](https://github.com/DynastyProcess), which serves up Shiny applications to help dynasty fantasy football owners make better decisions. It's also a home for [open data](https://github.com/DynastyProcess/Data) that helps support developers looking to build fantasy football spreadsheets and tools. I also build data tools and contribute at [DynastyLeagueFootball.com](https://dynastyleaguefootball.com).

I've recently joined the [R for Data Science Community on Slack](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) where I enjoy helping others out with R, Tidyverse, and Shiny questions. I'm also avidly following along with the [Advanced R Book Club](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-advanced_r) - I've even presented a few chapters!

Away from my keyboard, I'm a rower and coach for the [Ottawa Rowing Club](https://ottawarowingclub.com), where I'm a lead coach for the recreational and adult rowing programs. 

## Now
I was inspired to have a [now page](https://tanho.ca/now) by Derek Sivers - the [big idea](https://nownownow.com/about) being a page where you can find what this person is focused on at this point in their life. These entries for me tend to get quite introspective and I update them infrequently. I find it a nice way to both look back at how things have gone recently and look forward at the things I'd like to accomplish. 

In development terms, I'm currently absorbed in a brand new R package called [ffscrapR](https://github.com/DynastyProcess/ffscrapr) - it aims to abstract and share all of my experience with fantasy football platforms and APIs into one (hopefully definitive) R package. My ambition is for it to work as one interface for all of the common fantasy football platforms, and to get it submitted to CRAN!
